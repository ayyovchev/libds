Digital Services in Libraries

The data for this project is coming from the Institute of Museum and Library Services in the USA. The data is open for public use and can be found on www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey/.

My project was inspired by the book Practical SQL by Anthony DeBarros. The code for my project is similar to the code in the book written by Anthony DeBarros and I amended the code to fulfil the requirements of my analysis.
