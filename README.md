Analysis on digital services usage in USA libraries for 2018 and 2019 fiscal years.

This is descriptive analysis from the data for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019, focusing on the usage of digital services provided by USA libraries.

The project compares the trends between visits in the libraries, use of public computers, wifi sessions and libraries websites visits.

The data for this project is coming from the Institute of Museum and Library Services in the USA. The data is open for public use and can be found on www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey/.

My project was inspired and my code was adapted by the book Practical SQL by Anthony DeBarros https://nostarch.com/practicalSQL/.

Data downloaded and initially cleaned from the original csv file with Excel. Columns that are not needed for the project were removed.
Data uploaded in PostgreSQL Database to utilise the SQL power of Joining tables and aggregate data.
After the required SQL queries were completed, the temporary tables were downloaded and imported in Excel file for further small amendmends before the visualisation process.
Visualisation is completed in Power BI and will be uploaded here once is ready.
